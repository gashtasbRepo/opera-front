## How to Read the Code

### Entry Point

- **Starting Point:**  
  The application starts at the entry file (`src/index.js`). This file handles the initial setup, loading configuration, initializing modules, and rendering the main component.

### Components and Modules

- **Components:**  
  Located in `src/components`, containing modular and reusable UI components.

- **Services:**  
  Found in `src/services`, handling business logic and API interactions.

- **Utilities:**  
  Reusable helper functions are in `src/utils`.

### Understanding the Code Flow

1. **Follow the entry point:**  
   Start with `src/index.js` to understand app initialization.
2. **Trace function calls:**  
   Follow function calls to see how modules interact.
3. **Comments and Documentation:**  
   Check inline comments and docstrings for context.
4. **Tests:**  
   Review tests to understand expected behavior.
